<h4 class="titree">PERSONAL LIFE...</h4>
<p class="textlife">
<strong><i> Tupac Amaru Shakur </i></strong> was born on June 16, 1971, in the East Harlem section of New York City's Manhattan borough.
While born Lesane Parish Crooks,he was renamed, at age one, after Túpac Amaru II (the descendant of the last Incan ruler, Túpac Amaru), who was executed in Peru in 1781 after his failed revolt against Spanish rule.[18]
Shakur's mother explained, "I wanted him to have the name of revolutionary, indigenous people in the world. 
I wanted him to know he was part of a world culture and not just from a neighborhood.
"Tupac had an older stepbrother, Mopreme "Komani" Shakur, and a half-sister, Sekyiwa, two years his junior.
His parents, Afeni Shakur—born Alice Faye Williams in North Carolina—and his birth father, Billy Garland, had been active Black Panther Party members in New York in the late 1960s and early 1970s.

MUSIC CAREER...
</h4>
<p class="textlife">
In January 1991, Tupac, rapper, nationally debuted under the stage name 2Pac, guest on rap group Digital Underground's single "Same Song," compiled on the soundtrack of the February 1991 movie Nothing but Trouble.
2Pac's first two solo albums, November 1991's 2Pacalypse Now and February 1993's Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z..., preceded September 1994's eponymous and only album of his side group Thug Life, himself in it.
Rapper/producer Stretch guests on the above, three 2Pac projects.
2Pac's third solo album, March 1995's Me Against the World, features rap clique Dramacydal, reshaping as the Outlawz on 2Pac's fourth solo.
The fourth 2Pac solo album, and last in his lifetime, February 1996's All Eyez on Me, features also, among its numerous guests, Thug Life member Big Syke.
Yet another solo album was already finished.
November 1996's The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory, under the stage name Makaveli, is a studio album made in one August week, whereas later posthumous albums are archival productions.
Later posthumous albums are R U Still Down? (1997), Greatest Hits (1998), Still I Rise (1999), Until the End of Time (2001), Better Dayz (2002), Loyal to the Game (2004), Pac's Life (2006).

SUPERSTARDOM:1995-1996...
</h4>
<p class="textlife">While imprisoned February to October 1995, Tupac wrote only one song, he would say.
Rather, he took to political theorist Niccolò Machiavelli's treatise The Prince and military strategist Sun Tzu's treatise The Art of War.
And on Tupac's behalf, his wife Keisha Morris communicated to Suge Knight of Death Row Records that Tupac, in dire straits financially, needed help, his mother about to lose her house.
In August, after sending $15,000 for her, Suge began visiting Tupac in prison.
In one of his letters to Nina Bhadreshwar, recently hired edit a planned magazine, Death Row Uncut,Tupac discusses plans to start a "new chapter."
Eventually, music journalist Kevin Powell would say that Shakur, once released, more aggressive, "seemed like a completely transformed person.
2Pac's fourth album, All Eyez on Me, arrived on February 13, 1996. Of two discs, it basically was rap's first double album—meeting two of the three albums due in Tupac's contract with Death Row—and bore five singles while perhaps marking the peak of 1990s rap.
With standout production,the album has more party tracks and often a triumphant tone.
As 2Pac's second album to hit #1 on both the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart and the pop albums chart, the Billboard 200,it sold 566,000 copies in its first week and was it was certified 5× Multi-Platinum in April."How Do U Want It" as well as "California Love" reached #1 on the Billboard Hot 100. At the 1997 Soul Train Awards, it won in R&B/Soul or Rap Album of the Year.
At the 24th American Music Awards, Tupac won in Favorite Rap/Hip-Hop Artist.
The album was certified 9× Multi-Platinum in June 1998,and 10× in July 2014.
Tupac's fifth and final studio album, The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory, commonly called simply The 7 Day Theory, was released under a newer stage name, Makaveli.
This album had been created in seven days total during August 1996.
The lyrics were written and recorded in three days, and mixing took another four days. In 2005, MTV.com ranked The 7 Day Theory at #9 among the hip hop's greatest albums ever,and by 2006 a classic album.
Its singular poignance, through hurt and rage, contemplation and vendetta, resonate with many fans.
But according to George "Papa G" Pryce, Death Row Records' then director of public relations, the album was meant to be "underground," and "was not really to come out," but, "after Tupac was murdered, it did come out.
It peaked at #1 on Billboard's Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart and on the Billboard 200,with the second-highest debut-week sales total of any album that year.
On June 15, 1999, it was certified 4× Multi-Platinum.
